# Image gradients

- Definition of image gradient?
  - Vector of two images, each generated by applying a Sobel filter
  - Mathematically $\nabla f=[\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}]=[S_x \otimes f,S_y \otimes f]$
    - $S_x$ is the horizontal Sobel filter and detects vertical edges
    - $S_y$ is the vertical Sobel filter and detects horizontal edges
  - The gradient points in the direction of most rapid increase in intensity
- 1D finite difference Sobel
- 2D finite difference Laplace
