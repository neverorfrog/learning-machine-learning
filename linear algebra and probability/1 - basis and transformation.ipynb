    "### What is a basis?\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can define a basis as n linearly independent vectors (which are always columns)\n",
    "- These vectors define the coordinate system in which every vector is a scaled version of the basis vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "### Changing the basis\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we have two sets of basis vectors A and B, when expressed in their own RF they all are the identity matrix\n",
    "- But when we express eg B as seen from A this is what happens:\n",
    "  - We have a vector expressed in frame B\n",
    "  - Then B is a transformation that maps frame A to frame B\n",
    "  - And by multiplying B by a vector we apply a transformation, namely we bring a vector expressed in B into A\n",
