# Generative Models

- Estimate the class-conditional densities $P(x|C_i)$
  - Instead of assigning to an image the probability of being cat or dog, genmodels learn the features of cats and dogs, generate a sample relative to a dog and check if the to-be-classified sample has similar enough features (with Bayes)
