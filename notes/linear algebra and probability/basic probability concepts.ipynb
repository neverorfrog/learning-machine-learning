    "# Likelihood\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "- Let X1, X2, ..., Xn have a joint density function p(X1, X2, ..., Xn|θ)  \n",
    "- Given X1 = x1, X2 = x2, ..., Xn = xn is observed\n",
    "- L(θ) = L(θ|x1, x2, ..., xn) = p(x1, x2, ..., xn|θ) is the likelihood function\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuitively\n",
    "- It means in L we observe results and \"keep them fixed\" and look at how probabilities of having that results change when changing the parameter $\\theta$  \n",
    "- Likelihood tells you the probability (under the model ...) of the data, if data was generated according to that value of θ\n",
    "- The likelihood function is not a probability density function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Difference with posterior probability\n",
    "\n",
    "- Likelihood takes into account that some examples were already drawn\n",
    "- Posterior probability is computed even before we sample the distribution\n",
    "- Posterior $ \\implies  p(x | y)$\n",
    "- Likelihood $ \\implies L(w) = p(y | x; w) $ and it's not a pmf becaus $w$ is not a random variable"
