    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we have a sum of sinusoids we want to decompose into the single sinusoids (one for each frequency)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sinusoid is an oscillating and rotating vector on unit circle\n",
    "\n",
    "- Euler formula: $x + iy = cos \\rho + i sin \\rho = e^{i\\rho}$\n",
    "    - $\\rho$ is how much, in radians, i am far away from 0 going counterclockwise\n",
    "    - $e^{i2\\pi}$ is a full rotation\n",
    "- Rotation in function of time: $e^{i2\\pi t f}$\n",
    "    - $t$ is time in seconds\n",
    "    - $f$ is the (wound-up) frequency: how much rotation is done every second\n",
    "- Finally, if my sinusoid is $g(t)$, the wound-up version is $g(t) \\cdot e^{i2\\pi t f}$\n",
    "    - We have two frequencies\n",
    "        - Wound-up frequency $f$\n",
    "        - Frequency of the sinusoid $g(t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fourier Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "- Wound-up graph have a center of mass\n",
    "    - We sample many points on $g(t)$ and make an average\n",
    "- So FT is integral that gives complex number from a sinusoid in time\n",
    "    - $\\hat g(f) = \\int{g(t) \\cdot e^{-i2\\pi t f} dt}$\n",
    "- This number represents the strength of the sinusoid in that frequency\n",
    "    - Intuitively it is the distance of the com of the wound-up graph from the origin\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discrete Fourier Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "- Signal s of length $N$\n",
    "- $\\zeta = e^{-\\frac{2\\pi i}{N}}$ is one nth of a rotation around the unit circle\n",
    "    - it is a vector in the complex plane\n",
    "- $\\zeta ^ f$ means we are rotating around unit circle at frequency $f$\n",
    "    - in the same time the signal ends, we have rotated $f$ times around the circle\n",
    "- $\\hat s[f] = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} s[n] \\cdot \\zeta^{f n}$\n",
    "    - given f, we multiply each sample of s (a scalar in 1D) with the nth vector if we would unitcircling at that frequency\n",
    "- practically a weighted mean of the vectors at a certain frequency, with weights the samples of the signals\n",
    "- if the weighted mean (com) is far away from the origin, that frequency is present in the signal"
